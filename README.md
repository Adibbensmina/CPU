# CPU

.It's a project that simulate CPU in scheduling it's processes.<br />
.A simple GUI will be created to show the sumulation.<br />

# Algorithm to simulate

.Non-Preemptive Shortest-Job First (SJF).<br />
.Shortest- Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling using context switching.<br />
.Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling (SJF).<br />
.Round Robin (RR).<br />
.CPU algorithm that schedules processes based on priority.<br />
