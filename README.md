# CPU
.It's a project that simulate CPU in scheduling it's processes.
.A simple GUI will be created to show the sumulation.

# Algorithm to simulate
.Non-Preemptive Shortest-Job First (SJF).
.Shortest- Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling using context switching.
.Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling (SJF).
.Round Robin (RR).
.CPU algorithm that schedules processes based on priority..
