# CPU
.It's a project that simulate CPU in scheduling it's processes.
.A simple GUI will be created to show the sumulation.

# Algorithm to simulate
Non-Preemptive Shortest-Job First (SJF).
Shortest- Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling using context switching.
Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling (SJF) with starvation solution.
Round Robin (RR).
CPU algorithm that schedules processes based on priority.
